## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  
Academix is built using modern, industry-standard technologies to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability:  
- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable server-side applications).  
- **Language**: TypeScript (for type safety and better code maintainability).  
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO (for real-time chat and notifications).  
- **Database**: MySQL (managed via TypeORM for ORM and query optimization).  
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT) and Passport.js (for secure and flexible authentication strategies).  
- **API Documentation**: Swagger (OpenAPI) for interactive and clear API documentation.  
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS (for deployment, scaling, and high availability‚Äîe.g., EC2, RDS for MySQL, S3 for file storage, if applicable).  
- **ORM**: TypeORM (for database modeling and migrations).  
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `package.json` (install with `npm install`).

```
(Customize based on your MySQL, AWS, and authentication configurations.)

### 4. Configure MySQL Database  
Create a MySQL database named `academix_db` (or as specified in `.env`).
Run TypeORM migrations to set up the schema:
```bash
npx typeorm migration:run  
```

### 5. Run the Application  
Start the NestJS server in development mode:
```bash
npm run start:dev  
```

### 6. Access the API  
View the Swagger documentation at [http://localhost:3000/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger) (or your configured port) to explore and test endpoints.

## üìñ Usage  
Academix provides a rich API for interacting with its features. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

### Example: Authenticating a User  
- Send a POST request to `/auth/user-existence` to check if a user exists.
- Log in with `/auth/check-login` using JWT or Passport strategies (e.g., Google OAuth).
- Use the token to access protected routes like `/user/profile`.

### Example: Creating a Course  
- Authenticate as an instructor.
- Send a POST request to `/course` with course details (e.g., title, description, category).
- Manage real-time interactions (e.g., chat) via Socket.IO endpoints.

Refer to the Swagger UI for all available endpoints, request/response schemas, and example payloads.

## üìù API Documentation  
Academix‚Äôs API is fully documented using Swagger (OpenAPI). Access the interactive documentation at:
- **Local:** [http://localhost:3000/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger) (after running the app).
- **Online:** (If deployed on AWS, provide the public URL here.)

The Swagger UI includes:
- All endpoints (e.g., Auth, User, Course, Blog, Payment, etc.).
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Request/response schemas for each endpoint, including authentication (JWT/Passport) and real-time features (Socket.IO).

## ü§ù Contributing  
We welcome contributions to enhance Academix! Here‚Äôs how you can help:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "Add feature: Your description"`.
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.

## üåç Deployment on AWS  
To deploy Academix on AWS:
- **Database:** Use AWS RDS for MySQL to host your database, ensuring scalability and backups.
- **Backend:** Deploy the NestJS app on AWS EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or Lambda.
- **Real-time Communication:** Configure Socket.IO with AWS services (e.g., Elastic Load Balancer or API Gateway for WebSocket support).
- **File Storage:** Use AWS S3 for storing course materials, blog images, and other uploads (if Multer is integrated).
- **API Gateway:** Optionally, use AWS API Gateway for routing and scaling API requests.
- **Load Balancing & Scaling:** Configure AWS ELB and Auto Scaling for high availability.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manage `.env` variables using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

Ensure proper CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions) for automated deployments.
